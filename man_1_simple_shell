This shell reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and executes commands.

.PP

.B Invocation

Compile simple_shell with the GNU Compiler Collection, preferably using gcc plus the below specified flags, as per this example:
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
New shell can be run in interactive mode by entering the below command on the command line followd by "enter." Note that the prompt ('$') will appear and you will then be in interactive mode and able to enter commands followed by "enter." 
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE
New shell can be run in non-interactive mode through the use of shell scripts. This can involve the use of piping ('|'):
.P
.RS
.B echo 'ls' | ./hsh

.SH EXECUTABLES

Example of executables:
.IP
.br
.\&
.RS
\&$ echo "Example of executables"
.br
\&"Example of executables"
.br
\&$

.IT

.B Command Exit Status

Each command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour of other shell commands.  The paradigm is that a command exits with zero for normal or success, and non-zero for failure, error, or a false indication.

.SH FORMAT 
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream 

.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
Please report any issues to the authors.
